## Group decision making machine learning models
This repository contains an attempt to build group decision-making models in case of the classification task on the
example of Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine of the VIII convocation.

* Task: multi-target multi-output classification;
* algorithms: KNearestNeighbors, DecisionTree, RandomForest, LDA for generating new feature;
* metrics: accuracy, F1-measure.

The most important model parameters were tuned by GridSearchCV.
